# Schema and Type Derivation Guide
This guide explains the purpose of JSON schemas and how they relate to the TypeScript types in this project.
## Purpose of JSON Schemas
JSON schemas are used to **validate JSON files** that represent challenges, expectations, and other structured data in the project. They ensure that the data adheres to a predefined structure, providing consistency and reliability.
In this project, JSON schemas serve as the **source of truth** for these data structures. By deriving TypeScript types from schemas, we ensure the codebase remains consistent with the data definitions.
## Workflow for Updating Types
Types in the `src/interfaces` folder are declared based on the corresponding JSON schemas. As a result, **any updates to the schemas require regeneration of the TypeScript types**. However, schema updates are rare and should be well-documented whenever they occur.
### Steps to Update and Regenerate Types:
1. **Update the Schema**:
If a change is required, modify the respective schema file in the `schema/` directory.
2. **Regenerate Types**:
Use the following command to regenerate TypeScript interfaces from the updated schema:
``` bash
   npm run get-type-from-schema
```
This command will process all schemas from the `schema/` folder and output corresponding TypeScript interfaces in `src/interfaces`.
1. **Update Types in Code**:
After the interfaces are regenerated, update any dependent code in the project to use the updated types.

### Example:
If the `challenge_schema.json` is updated, the `Challenge` and its related interfaces in the generated file need to be re-imported in the dependent codebase.
## Key Takeaways
- **Start with Schema**: Always prioritize working with JSON schemas for defining or editing data structures.
- **Regenerate Types**: Use the tools and scripts provided to keep TypeScript types synchronized with the schemas.
- **Interfaces Depend on Schemas**: Types declared in the `src/interfaces/` folder use the autogenerated types and may import them.

By adhering to this workflow, we ensure consistency between the data, schema, and TypeScript types throughout the project.
